## 📊 Project Status

- **Total Repository Issues**: 105
- **Project Items**: 42 (5 Epics + 37 User Stories)
- **All items properly**:
  - ✅ Created as repository issues
  - ✅ Added to project board
  - ✅ Type field set correctly (Epic/User Story)
  - ✅ Linked as sub-issues (Stories → Epics)
  - ✅ Include documentation links

## 🔄 Restoration Process

1. **Epics**: Already existed (created earlier)
2. **User Stories**: Created using same algorithm as engineering tasks:
   - Create draft issue in project
   - Set Type field to "User Story"
   - Convert to repository issue
   - Link as sub-issue to parent Epic

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Create Engineering Tasks**:
   - Use the enhanced scripts (Parts 1-3)
   - Each user story needs 2-3 engineering tasks
   - Total: ~100+ engineering tasks

2. **Sprint Planning**:
   - Assign story points
   - Prioritize based on dependencies
   - Create sprint milestones

3. **Team Assignment**:
   - Assign epics to epic owners
   - Distribute user stories
   - Balance workload
