# Pre-commit Hook Rules

## Code Principles Enforcement (SOLID, KISS, DRY, Clean Code)
- Verify functions are under 20-30 lines (KISS)
- Check for code duplication (DRY)
- Ensure single responsibility per class/function (SOLID-S)
- Validate meaningful variable and function names (Clean Code)
- Check complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity <10)
- Ensure no deeply nested code (>3 levels)
- Verify interfaces are segregated properly (SOLID-I)
- Check for proper abstractions (SOLID-D)

## Code Quality Checks
- Run linters for all modified files
- Check for syntax errors in code files
- Validate JSON and YAML files
- Ensure no debugger statements in code
- Check for console.log statements in production code
- Detect code smells (long methods, large classes)
- Check for magic numbers/strings
- Validate consistent code formatting

## Security Checks
- Scan for hardcoded credentials
- Check for exposed API keys
- Validate no sensitive information in commits
- Ensure no private keys or certificates are committed

## File Checks
- Verify no large binary files (>10MB)
- Check for trailing whitespace
- Ensure files end with newline
- Validate file permissions are correct
- Check for merge conflict markers

## Testing Requirements
- Run unit tests for modified files
- Ensure test coverage meets minimum threshold
- Validate no broken tests

## Documentation
- Check for missing documentation in new functions
- Ensure README updates for new features
- Validate markdown formatting

## Project Specific
- Ensure package-lock.json is updated with package.json
- Check for unused dependencies
- Validate import statements
