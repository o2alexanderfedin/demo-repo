### Commands Executed
```bash
# Repository initialization
git init
gh repo create demo-repo --public
git remote add origin https://github.com/o2alexanderfedin/demo-repo.git
git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master

# GitFlow setup
git flow version
git flow init -d
mkdir -p .git/hooks
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-flow-feature-start
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push

# Final commits
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: add git hook rules and CLAUDE.md reference"
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: add GitFlow integration with Claude-aware hooks"
git push origin develop
```

### Files Modified
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Updated permissions for git operations
- `.claude/pre-commit.rules` - Created comprehensive pre-commit validation rules
- `.claude/commit-msg.rules` - Created commit message format rules
- `.claude/pre-push.rules` - Created pre-push validation rules
- `CLAUDE.md` - Created project reference documentation with GitFlow section
- `.git/hooks/post-flow-feature-start` - Created hook for GitFlow feature tracking
- `.git/hooks/post-commit` - Created hook for commit reminders
- `.git/hooks/pre-push` - Created hook for push reminders
- `.claude/conversations/template.md` - Created conversation template
- `.claude/conversations/2025-01-21-session-001.md` - This conversation log

### Key Decisions
- Used GitFlow branching model for better feature management
- Implemented Claude-aware hooks to provide AI context during development
- Created `.claude/gitflow-status.env` file to track feature progress
- Established conversation tracking in todo listicle format for future reference

### Follow-up Items
- [ ] Complete conversation tracking system implementation
- [ ] Test GitFlow hooks with actual feature development
- [ ] Consider adding automated tests for git hooks
- [ ] Document hook customization options
- [ ] Create automated conversation log generator

### Notes
- GitFlow was successfully initialized with default branch names (master/develop)
- All hooks are executable and will trigger automatically
- The `.claude/gitflow-status.env` file will be created when starting a new feature
- Developers should update FEATURE_DESCRIPTION in the status file when starting features
- Repository URL: https://github.com/o2alexanderfedin/demo-repo
