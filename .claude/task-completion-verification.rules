# Task Completion Verification Rules

## Overview
These rules ensure thorough task completion verification before declaring any task as "done". This applies to all tasks, especially documentation generation, code implementation, and system configuration.

## General Verification Checklist

### 1. Task Completeness
- [ ] All requested items have been created/implemented
- [ ] No partial implementations left unfinished
- [ ] All subtasks identified and completed
- [ ] Edge cases considered and handled
- [ ] No empty directories or placeholder files

### 2. Documentation Specific Rules

#### Structure Verification
- [ ] All planned sections have corresponding files
- [ ] No empty directories in documentation structure
- [ ] Table of contents matches actual file structure
- [ ] All navigation links are present in each file
- [ ] README files exist for each major section

#### Content Verification
- [ ] Each document has complete content (no TODOs or placeholders)
- [ ] All code examples are syntactically correct
- [ ] Mermaid diagrams render properly
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified against source material
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout all documents

#### Link Verification
- [ ] All internal links point to existing files
- [ ] Navigation links (Home, Up, Previous, Next) are correct
- [ ] Cross-references between documents are valid
- [ ] No broken links or incorrect paths
- [ ] Relative paths used consistently

#### Reference Validation
- [ ] All referenced classes/methods exist in codebase
- [ ] File paths in examples are correct
- [ ] Import statements are accurate
- [ ] Version numbers and compatibility info current
- [ ] External references (URLs) are valid

## Verification Process

### 1. Automated Checks
```bash
# Check for empty directories
find <root> -type d -empty

# Check for broken internal links
grep -r "\[.*\](.*.md)" <docs_root> | # Extract all markdown links
  # Verify each link points to existing file

# Check for TODO/FIXME/placeholder text
grep -r -i "todo\|fixme\|placeholder\|tbd" <docs_root>

# Verify navigation consistency
# Each file should have navigation header/footer
grep -L "Navigation:" <docs_root>/*.md

# Check for missing files from TOC
# Compare index.md links with actual files
```

### 2. Manual Verification Steps

#### Step 1: Structure Audit
1. Compare planned structure with actual directories
2. Verify no missing sections or files
3. Check file naming consistency
4. Ensure logical organization

#### Step 2: Content Review
1. Open each file and verify completeness
2. Check for placeholder content
3. Verify technical accuracy
4. Ensure examples are working

#### Step 3: Navigation Test
1. Start from index/home page
2. Follow all navigation links
3. Verify bidirectional navigation works
4. Test cross-references between sections

#### Step 4: Reference Validation
1. Verify code references against source
2. Check import paths and package names
3. Validate class/method signatures
4. Confirm version compatibility

## Completion Criteria

### Documentation is Complete When:
1. **100% File Coverage**: All planned files exist with full content
2. **Zero Empty Directories**: No empty folders in structure
3. **All Links Valid**: Every link points to existing content
4. **Navigation Works**: Can navigate between all documents
5. **References Accurate**: All code references are correct
6. **No Placeholders**: No TODO, TBD, or placeholder text
7. **Consistent Quality**: All documents meet quality standards

### Code/Implementation is Complete When:
1. **All Features Implemented**: No missing functionality
2. **Tests Pass**: All tests written and passing
3. **Documentation Updated**: Docs reflect implementation
4. **Error Handling**: All error cases handled
5. **Code Review Ready**: Follows all coding standards

## Reporting Format

### Completion Report Template
```markdown
## Task Completion Report

### Task: [Task Name]
**Date**: [Date]
**Status**: [Complete/Incomplete]

### Deliverables Checklist
- [x] Item 1: Description (verified)
- [x] Item 2: Description (verified)
- [ ] Item 3: Description (pending)

### Verification Results
**Structure Check**: [Pass/Fail]
- Total files expected: X
- Total files created: Y
- Empty directories: Z

**Content Check**: [Pass/Fail]
- Files with complete content: X/Y
- Files with placeholders: List

**Link Verification**: [Pass/Fail]
- Total links: X
- Broken links: Y
- Details: [List broken links]

**Reference Validation**: [Pass/Fail]
- Code references verified: X/Y
- Invalid references: [List]

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Premature Completion
- Declaring done without checking all files
- Assuming structure means content is complete
- Not testing navigation and links
- Skipping reference validation

### 2. Incomplete Verification
- Only checking file existence, not content
- Not following links to verify they work
- Missing cross-reference validation
- Ignoring empty directories

### 3. Quality Issues
- Accepting placeholder content
- Not verifying technical accuracy
- Inconsistent formatting/style
- Missing error scenarios

## Enforcement

### When to Apply These Rules
1. Before declaring any task complete
2. After generating documentation sets
3. Before committing/pushing changes
4. During code review preparation
5. At project milestones

### Consequences of Skipping Verification
- Incomplete deliverables
- Broken user experience
- Technical debt accumulation
- Rework required later
- Loss of credibility

## Tools and Scripts

### Verification Script Template
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Task completion verification script"""

import os
import re
from pathlib import Path

class TaskVerifier:
    def __init__(self, root_path):
        self.root = Path(root_path)
        self.errors = []
        self.warnings = []
        
    def verify_structure(self):
        """Check directory structure completeness"""
        # Implementation
        
    def verify_content(self):
        """Check file content completeness"""
        # Implementation
        
    def verify_links(self):
        """Verify all links are valid"""
        # Implementation
        
    def verify_references(self):
        """Validate code references"""
        # Implementation
        
    def generate_report(self):
        """Generate completion report"""
        # Implementation

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verifier = TaskVerifier("./docs")
    verifier.run_all_checks()
    verifier.generate_report()
```

## Summary

**Never declare a task complete without:**
1. Running all verification checks
2. Fixing identified issues
3. Generating completion report
4. Confirming all criteria met
5. Double-checking critical paths

**Remember**: It's better to spend time verifying than to deliver incomplete work.
